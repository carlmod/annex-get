* Annex-get

Annex get is a gui to make manual management of a git annex repository easy.

My personal use case is my movie collection. While having all movies saflly 
stored on my fileserver I want to quickly 'get' one or two movies or tv-episodes
to watch, and then manually drop them individually, or to just drop all of them
at the same time. 

Compared to the Git-annex assistant the scope is quite different. The assistant
has the aim to make sure that files automaticly are in the specified 
repositories. To manually ster what files are avalible is not trivially 
possible using the assistant.

The manual getting and dropping of files are of course trivially possible using
the normal CLI, and annex-git aims to bring that ease to a GUI.
